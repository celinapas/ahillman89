- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ahillman89
- Iâ€™m interested in autonomy, software safety, and manned-unmanned teaming.
- Iâ€™m currently a PhD student at MIT
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on autonomy projects, particularly UAM

- To use the project's Jupyter notebook, you'll need the image files (png) and the Jupyter Notebook file.
- You can open these in a Jupyter Hub instance or on your own Jupyter Notebook thorugh Anaconda
