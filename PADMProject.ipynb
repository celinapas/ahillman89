    "Our problem focuses around an industrial bakery and how to optimize the production and deliver to minimize cost and maximize gain. From this general statement, we envision four different automation areas:\n",
    "1. Production optimization: focused on the factories themselves, we want to decide when and how to produce certain products. We formulate the problem as a decision of how many days we need each factory to produce each product, in order to meet the clients' requirements. This is a classic example of Linear Programming, where we need to account for the supply and demand constraints to obtain, not only a feasible solution, but also an optimized one.\n",
    "2. Product fitting: once we have the products, we need to fit them products into a truck. Since the objective is to maximize revenue, we want to fit the maximum value into a volume-limited truck. This is a classic instance of a Knapsack problem, which is a subclass of the more general Constrained Problems.\n",
    "3. Vehicle routing: once the truck is filled, the objective is to bring the products to the clients using the most efficient route. This is a classic instance of the travel salesman problem, where we need to visit certain locations in order to sell the products.\n",
    "4. Truck diagnosis and repairing: since trucks are a fundamental factor in our business case, we need to ensure that we can diagnose, at any point, the state of the truck and be able to determine a correct repairing procedure to avoid unnecessary delays.\n",

    "Finally, we can describe the function that performs a best-first search towards the most probable configurations. Note that we are talking about configurations in plural because we want a probability estimate for each one. Each function will have the capability of either inputing how many diagnoses to return, or the desired threshold probability. As mentioned, the logic of the tree relies on kernel diagnoses and conflicts: once a specific state is reached, if the state is valid for the model, it is added to the return list and, if not, the underlying conflict is extracted and the whole search is restarted with the new information. Although this may seem to add innecessary computation, in reality the algorithm runs much faster due to the early pruning of invalid options."

    "The previous functions return the set of most probable diagnoses according to a set of observed symptoms. However, when the possible diagnoses is large (due to diagnoses with similar probabilities, or a large confidence value), reading through all of them and determining the best course of action might be a nightmare. The objective of the next part is to automatically determine the best course of action given a set of diagnoses and their probability, a set of repairing actions, a goal state, and a confidence probability value. In plain words, we want that, not matter what the actual correct diagnoses is, to ensure that after the repairs we get to the desired state with at least a given probability. This can be done using a best-first search where now the cost value is the cost of the repairings."
